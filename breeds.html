        <h2>The Dachsund</h2>
        <p>
            <img SRC="set2/da.jpg"><br>
            PHYSICAL APPEARANCE AND TEMPERAMENT:
            The Dachshund is also known as a 'sausage dog' and has a very low body that is close to the ground, and is elongated. The Dachshund has a muscular and sturdy build, and his expression is a sweet and eager one. There are three varieties of Dachshund, and this includes the longhaired, the smooth haired, and the wirehaired variety. The miniature Dachshund weighs in at 7 to 11 pounds,
            and standard Dachshunds are around 20-28 pounds. The height of the Dachshund is 5 inches for miniatures and around 8-10 inches 
            Dachshunds are a very clownish breed and can be very mischievous at times. A very intuitive dog, the Dachshund is now most commonly seen as a companion rather than a hunter. This breed loves to be around people. Dachshunds are very clever dogs. 
            TheThe Long Haired variety requires quite a bit of grooming. Being that this dog is so low to the ground, he is prone to getting burrs, sticks, and twigs stuck in his coat which should be removed daily if any are present. Brushing of the coat should be done on a regular basis to prevent tangling and/or matting. 
            Dachshund is a fun loving dog, tenacious, and lively, but can become jealous and be very irritable. This breed does not do well with smaller children, but can do very well with older and more considerate children. Due to his small size and tiny legs, this breed should not be placed in a home with larger dogs unless they were raised around each other.
            TRAINING, EXERCISE AND HEALTH ISSUES:
            Dachshunds are prone to spinal disc problems, also known as Dachshund paralysis. This is due to their very long spinal columns and very short rib cages. Dogs with this problem can become completely paralyzed. For this reason, it's important that your dog be trained early on not to jump, as jumping puts additional pressure on the spine. They are also prone to Heart disease, urinary tract problems and diabetes. 
            This dog can become inactive as they age, which makes them prone to obesity. The life expectancy of the Dachshund is around 12-15 years.  A short walk per day would suffice for this short-bodied breed. The Dachshund tends to tire out easily so any exercise provided should be given at different times rather than one long walk. 
        </p><br><br>
        <h2>The Doberman Pinscher</h2>
        <p>
            <img SRC="set2/db.jpg"><br>
            PHYSICAL APPEARANCE AND TEMPERAMENT:
            The Doberman Pinscher is an elegant, muscular and very powerful dog. It has a well proportioned chest, a short back and a lean, muscular neck. Its hard, short-haired, close-fitting coat comes in black, black & tan, blue-gray, red, fawn and white. 
            Its teeth are strong and close in a scissors bite. Eyes are dark with a lively, intelligent expression. The ears are usually cropped (cut at the age of about 12 weeks). The pup's ears have to be taped for a couple of months to make them stand up. 
            Proud, noble, and alert, the Doberman Pinscher is a dog with plenty of devotion and love to give. These dutiful dogs tend to have an even, well balanced temperament, and are intelligent, creative, and quick to learn. The Doberman Pinscher excels in obedience training when it is positive and includes treats and lots of praise. They are one of the most intelligent and fastest learning of all breeds. These dogs are best suited to those who can establish themselves as "boss" from day one, as this breed can be strong willed and stubborn. 
            .The Doberman Pinscher can be reserved with strangers so plenty of socialization from a young age is important. He is fearless, powerful and protective of his loved ones. He will fight if provoked, and he definitely wont back down (unless trained to), making him an effective guard dog.
            TRAINING, EXERCISE AND HEALTH ISSUES:
            Doberman Pinschers require minimal grooming. Occasional brushing or wiping of the coat with a damp cloth will minimize loose hair. Dental hygiene is crucial to prevent early tooth loss. It is also important to keep their nails trimmed short.
            The life expectancy of the Doberman Pinscher is around 8-12 years, and there are a number of health problems and disorder linked to the breed. The Doberman Pinscher is prone to bloat, hip dysplasia, and congenital heart disorders. They do not do well in cold climates.
