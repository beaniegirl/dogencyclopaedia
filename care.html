        <div class="basics">Puppies should not be separated from their mother before they are 8 weeks old. At three to four weeks, puppies should begin eating some solid food. You can try mixing three parts food with one part water or puppy replacement milk . This will make the food easier for the puppy to digest. At 6-8 weeks of age you should Feed your puppy 3-4 times a day. Puppies have different nutritional needs than adult dogs. Choose a puppy food that provides the appropriate balance of nutrients your puppy needs. Be sure they are getting the right amount of protein and calcium, and the proper amount of calories. Check the label to determine if you are feeding your puppy a balanced diet. Meat should be the first ingredient on the label. Once the puppy is eight weeks old he should be fed twice a day. Continue with puppy food until the dog is a full year old. When dogs reach eight to nine months old feeding can be reduced to once a day. The correct amount to feed your dog depends upon the dogs size and should be listed on the dog food. The Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) has developed profiles for dog and puppy nutrition. These standards are reflected on the dog food label. This information will give you an idea of the food's content, but beware - the labels can be misleading. Just because a food meets AAFCO requirements, it does not mean that is the best food for your dog. Look for food companies that exceed AAFCO guidelines and use high-quality ingredients that are human-grade if possible.</div>

          <div class="basics">Most dogs enjoy being brushed, and sessions will strengthen the bond with your dog while maintaining a healthy coat. A dogâ€™s minimum brushing needs depend on hair type. Long-haired dogs usually require daily brushing to prevent matting and tangling of hair. Medium-haired dogs may be prone to matting and tangles and should be brushed at least weekly. Short-haired dogs can typically go up to a month in-between brushing. Regardless of hair type, you can brush your dog daily - especially if he enjoys it. More frequent brushing during shedding season can help prevent hair build-up and excess shedding. Mats are nasty entanglements of hair that may involve the topcoat, undercoat, dirt, burrs, loose hair hanging around and just about anything your dog may have gotten into. They can be quite damaging and even painful for your dog, so it is important to remove them before they become more serious matters! Keeping your dog free of hair mats is, unfortunately, an ongoing task that begins by establishing a foundation of regular grooming habits. Dead hair is a breeding ground for mats. A coat that is brushed and clean stays in better condition and is less likely to develop them. Dogs with continuously growing hair, such as the Poodle or Shih Tzu, typically need their hair cut every 2-4 weeks depending on the breed of the dog and the style of the cut. This task is often best left to professional groomers, though many dog owners are able to learn some basic maintenance haircuts. </div>

            As dog owners and people who care deeply for animals and wildlife, we wanted our Dog Encyclopedia to be a website that could empower pet owners to create the most positive, loving environment for their dogs. Dog Encyclopedia realizes that owning a dog is like adding a new member to your family.
            
            Training your dog strengthens the link between you both as you are learning to share a common language of words and signals. As your dog learns good dog training tricks and the basic obedience commands he also learns the language that will enable you to communicate with him on a day to day basis. As with all communication it is essential to remember that it is a two-way interaction. Learning to communicate effectively with your dog means that not only will you be able to accomplish more in your training. But you will also be able to stop behavioral problems when they start and even avoid them altogether. The dog that is trained to respond to basic commands is more fun and since you can direct his behavior you will have a more enjoyable life together. The bonds of friendship and trust, which develop as you train your dog, will have a positive effect on all areas of your life. Just think of the benefits having an obedient dog will bring. If you like to hike through the wild and want to take your dog with you, wouldn't it be wonderful if that when it was time to go home you simply gave a command and your dog came right to you. Remember training your dog is a process, which lasts his lifetime. The more time you put into becoming a good trainer the better you will be and the quicker your dog will learn. When you find the method that works for you and your dog don't change it as that will only frustrate you and confuse your dog</div>
